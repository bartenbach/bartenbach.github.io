# [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Difficulty: Easy

Problem statement:

> Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.  
>    
> Example:  
> Given a binary tree   
>    
> `         1   ` 
> `        / \  `
> `       2   3 ` 
> `      / \    `   
> `     4   5   `   
> Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].  
>     
> Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.  

Well folks, it was bound to happen again eventually.  I had to throw in the towel on this one and declare defeat.

At first I thought this was a simple problem, but the more I looked at it the more confused I got.  Me and Mikayla attempted to whiteboard this one out and had a solution that passed 103/107 testcases, but couldn't get through them all.

My solution was very close to the correct solution, but not quite as elegant.  Also, it didn't actually work, so I won't bother posting it :(
