In a time where there is so much uncertainty, things are really looking up.  I have a lot of exciting things on the horizon that I can't really talk about right now, but soon I will be disclosing a lot of exciting changes.

I hope to post more often here than I did on my previous blog now that it's so easy to do (and it's version controlled!).

I'd share more, but Mikayla just finished a group call with her family so I've got to go.  More to come...
