<h1>21 Mar 2020 | Things Are Looking Up</h1>
<p>In a time where there is so much uncertainty, things are really looking up.  I have a lot of exciting things on the horizon that I can’t really talk about right now, but soon I will be disclosing a lot of exciting changes.</p>

<p>I hope to post more often here than I did on my previous blog now that it’s so easy to do (and it’s version controlled!).</p>

<p>I’d share more, but Mikayla just finished a group call with her family so I’ve got to go.  More to come…</p>
