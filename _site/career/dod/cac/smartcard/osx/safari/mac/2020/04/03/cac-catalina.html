<h1>03 Apr 2020 | Using CAC with Mac OS Catalina and Safari</h1>
<p>After spending an unbelievable amount of time trying to get this working, I figured I’d throw together some steps to help anyone else out.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For Catalina, you need to uninstall all 3rd party CAC enablers.  You can do that by following these instructions: http://www.militarycac.com/macuninstall.htm</li>
  <li>Apple also gave the following guidance, which I followed: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210541</li>
  <li>I was never able to pair my smart card to the OS, until I found this article: https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006468-using-your-yubikey-as-a-smart-card-in-macos The important command here was <code class="highlighter-rouge">sc_auth pairing_ui -s enable</code> which started pairing.  After this, I was able to login to the OS using my CAC.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I blew away all certs in my keychain - this seems to play an important role.  You can find these by pressing command + space and launching “Keychain Access”.  Under login &gt; Certificates - I had a bunch of crap.  I blew away the entire folder, then from scratch, followed these instructions (Step 5): https://militarycac.com/macnotes.htm</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, nothing changed until I rebooted, at which point I was finally able to get a cert prompt and CAC in to DoD websites.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>
