<h1>A New Beginning</h1>
<p>08 Mar 2020</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of a new era for my online presence.  For years, I’ve self-hosted everything and paid for “enterprise-tier” internet services at home.  This worked for many years, but as work and school have picked up, I have really lacked the time to maintain everything involved in keeping it running.</p>

<p>Without going into too much detail about everything involved, my new domain is now hosted on an EC2 instance in the cloud that’s actually free right now because I’m a student.  It’s a 4-core cloud instance with 16GB of memory - plenty for all the mucking about I want to do (even minecraft server hosting for plugin development!).</p>
