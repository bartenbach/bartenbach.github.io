Hello, fellow human!  Welcome to my _web sight_.  My name is Blake Bartenbach and this is my
**personal** _web sight_.  I am a Software Engineer by trade and my hobbies include running, eating pizza, and 
watching weird shows on Netflix with my girlfriend Mikayla and the cats (more on the cats later).

### What's up with the design?
The design originally attempted to mimic a VT100 terminal, but it was just to horrific to look at.  From there it's just slowly continued to evolve to whatever I felt looked "good".  I'm not an expert web developer, but at least I can say I designed the entire website myself.

### Where's the cat information you promised me?
About that...Yeah, I lied.  Mikayla's website is still in the works.  I'll link it here when it goes live, though.
