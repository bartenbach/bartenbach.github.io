<div id="postcontainer">
  <p>Hello, fellow human!  Welcome to my <em>web sight</em>.  My name is Blake Bartenbach and this is my
<strong>personal</strong> <em>web sight</em>.  I am a Software Engineer by trade and my hobbies include running, eating pizza, and 
watching weird shows on Netflix with my girlfriend Mikayla and the cats (more on the cats later).</p>

<h3>What the hell is this design?</h3>
<p>Well, for starters, I must unfortunately admit I designed this look entirely myself.  The design is a throwback to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> terminal, although probably slightly more grotesque (if that's possible).  It's a design only a mother could love (or a weird CS major, I guess).</p>

<h3>Where's the cat information you promised me?</h3>
<p>About that...Yeah, I lied.  Mikayla's website is still in the works.  I'll link it here when it goes live, though.</p>
