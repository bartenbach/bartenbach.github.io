  <p>Hello, fellow human!  Welcome to my <em>web sight</em>.  My name is Blake Bartenbach and this is my
<strong>personal</strong> <em>web sight</em>.  I am a Software Engineer by trade and my hobbies include running, eating pizza, and 
watching weird shows on Netflix with my girlfriend Mikayla and the cats (more on the cats later).</p>
