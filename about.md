Hello, fellow human!  Welcome to my _web sight_.  My name is Blake Bartenbach and this is my
**personal** _web sight_.  I am a Software Engineer by trade and my hobbies include running, eating pizza, and 
watching weird shows on Netflix with my cat!

### What's up with the design?
The design originally attempted to mimic a VT100 terminal, but it was just to horrific to look at.  From there it's just slowly continued to evolve to whatever I felt looked "good".  I'm not much of a UI/UX guy, but at least I can say I designed the entire website myself.
